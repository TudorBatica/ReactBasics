# React Basics

Simple react app that illustrates some basic React concepts, such as:
- hooks(e.g.: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useParams`)
- routing
- consuming an API

## Getting started

Clone or download the project. Then, run:
- `npm install`: to restore dependencies
- `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`: to setup the server
- `npm run start`: to start the app

**I highly recommend [The Net Ninja's free course on youtube](https://youtu.be/j942wKiXFu8) to get started with React.**
